## Project Structure

Your assigned tasks live inside the stage directory for the current level:

```
stage{x}/
├── problems/
│   └── problem{x}/
│       ├── README.md        # Problem description and requirements
│       ├── starter.cpp      # Starter code (C++)
│       ├── starter.py       # Starter code (Python)
│       └── starter.java     # Starter code (Java)
│
├── solutions/
│   └── solution{x}/         # <-- Add your code here
│
└── tests/                   # DO NOT MODIFY
    └── test{x}/
        ├── input1.txt
        ├── input2.txt
        ├── input3.txt
        ├── expected1.txt
        ├── expected2.txt
        └── expected3.txt
```
 
- **`problems/`** — Contains one folder per problem, each with a README and starter files in C++, Python, and Java.
- **`solutions/`** — Place your finished code inside the corresponding `solution{x}/` folder. This is the only directory the grading system reads from.
- **`tests/`** — Contains input/expected output files used by the automated grader. **Do not touch anything here — modifying test files will result in disqualification.**

## How to check your code(using Terminal)

There is functionality to test your code through **Terminal** access. 
All IDEs should have some way to create **New Terminal** which may be used for testing.

In Clion, in the **Menu Bar** there is **View | Tool Windows | Terminal**.
In IntelliJ, similarly in the **Menu Bar** there is **View | Tool Windows | Terminal**.
In Visual Studio Code, in the **Menu Bar** there is **View > Terminal** or **Terminal > New Terminal**

Right-clicking a file may also lead to use of the **Terminal**.

The terminal should pop up as a seperate window in which to test your code.
By calling the line, **python3 -c runner.py** in the terminal you can test your code.
**Note** that this test will **NOT** count as a submission. 
It is only as useful as you make it for checking your code against the test cases.



## How to Submit

To ensure your work is graded, follow these specific submission rules:

1. **Main Branch Only** — Push your code directly to the `main` branch. Solutions on other branches will **not** be checked.
2. **Target Directory** — Only files placed inside the `solutions/` directory will be seen by the grading system.
3. **Push via Command Line:**

```bash
git add stage{x}/solutions/your_file.py
git commit -m "Solved problem X"
git push origin main
```

### Checking Your Results
 
After pushing, navigate to the **Actions** tab on GitHub to see your grading status:
 
- ✅ **Green** — All test cases passed! You have a correct solution and will be automatically progressed to the next stage.
- 🟡 **Yellow** — Still grading, please wait.
- ❌ **Red** — One or more test cases failed. Please recheck your solution.
 
### Moving to the Next Stage
 
Once you pass, go back to the **Code** tab on GitHub and confirm the next stage directory is present. If it isn't, alert an Event Organizer.
 
Then pull the latest changes to start working on the next stage:
 
```bash
git pull
```

## Important Rules

> **Please read carefully — do not ignore.**

To keep the automated grading system running smoothly:

- **DO NOT MODIFY** any files in the `.github/workflows/` directory.
- **DO NOT MODIFY** `grade.sh` or `runner.py`.
- Pushes to files **outside** of `solutions/` will be ignored by the automation scripts.

> [!CAUTION]
> Tampering with grading scripts or workflow files may result in **disqualification** or **failed stage progression**.
